This is the simple convolutional testing I did. 
This uses a variety of different shapes and kernel sizes, which I experimented with over the summer.

Included here will be:
- Training scripts
- Testing scripts
- Any notebooks I used to develop the process
- Checkpoints for my models
- Conda / pip package list
- images of predictions.
