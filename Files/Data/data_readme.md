This folder contains all the data processing and collection scripts I created. 
I started by learning the data compilation techniques from Google Earth Engine API, as seen in EE Testing and Further Testing.
I then developed the compilingData notebook, which tests key features, and then performs the downloading.

big_fires_data.ipynb is a notebook that I used towards the end of my project, when I was looking into perhaps better quality data.
While this was unfruitful, I decided to upload it anyway. 

The main data source, GLOBAL FIRE ATLAS comes from the link: https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/gfa/
