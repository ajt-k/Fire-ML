Welcome to my attempts at predicting forest fires!
To see data collection, processing, and interfacing with GEE, go to Files/Data
To see my first FCN in 2d go to Files/ConvSimple
To see all other testing, such as FCN_mark2, ConvLSTM, Conv3D, MultiConvLSTM, or others: go to Files/Conv+

Python version: 3.11.9
Package list for data collection is in Files/Data --> conda env
Torch version 2.2.2 for all tests.
Conv+: trained on AWS remote server
